// Placeholder for icon.png
// In a real extension, this would be an actual PNG image file
// For now, this serves as a placeholder to satisfy the manifest.json requirement

This is a placeholder text file for the extension icon. 
In a production extension, this would be replaced with an actual 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG image.
